  summary: "The Nittany Lion Club, aimed to equip each team with the necessary resources to independently help raise funds and engage their top donors. While each team previously had its own Excellence Fund dedicated to supporting its program, they lacked the tools to effectively engage donors in innovative ways. The introduction of the Insider Inbox addresses this gap by providing the necessary tools and strategies to enhance donor engagement and fundraising efforts.",
